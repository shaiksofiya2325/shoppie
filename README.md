## ‚ú® Core Features

"Shoppie" is a single-page application that allows users to browse products, view details, and manage a shopping cart without ever needing to reload the page.

* **Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are stored in a JavaScript array, and the product grid is generated dynamically, making the store easy to update and manage.
* **Advanced Filtering & Sorting System:**
    * **Category Filter:** Filter products by "Electronics," "Clothing," etc.
    * **Live Search Bar:** Instantly narrows down products by name as the user types.
    * **Price Range Slider:** Visually filter products below a maximum price.
    * **Sort Options:** Arrange products by price (Low to High, High to Low) or name (A-Z).
* **Detailed Product View:** Clicking a product opens a dedicated view with a larger image, a comprehensive description, and an "Add to Cart" button.
* **Persistent Shopping Cart:**
    * A modern slide-in modal allows users to view and manage their cart.
    * Users can **add**, **remove**, and **update item quantities**.
    * The cart state is saved to the browser's **Local Storage**, so items are remembered even after closing the tab.
* **Responsive and Modern UI:**
    * Built with a clean, light color scheme for excellent readability.
    * The layout uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
